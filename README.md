In the website I have done the following things for the tests:

1. When the user clicks a btn, the next question should show
2. If the user clicks the correct question, it should increment score
3. At the end the total score should be shown


First of all I have stored the list of the questions in the array then using the dot notation I have called the properties to access the question and the answer

Afterwards I have used the map function to loop over the array to fetch the differnt questions and answers from the array 

But specifically I have used hooks to change one question to another using useState

I have also made one function to check the correct answer and also to change the state

and also used the state to show the score over the screen and also used the ternary operator to switch between the score or display the question section
